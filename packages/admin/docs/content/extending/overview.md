# Extending Tinoecom

Although Tinoecom is primarily designed for e-commerce sites and has many associated features, you are free to add or modify existing ones.

## Why extends Tinoecom

One might ask, knowing that the purpose of setting up an e-commerce site is simply to make the whole system work without always wanting to add to it.

For example if you want a blog on your store, a section for a KYC, or maybe a forum, instead of creating another project to manage this you can directly extend Tinoecom to manage all this in the same administration area.

## How to extend Tinoecom

To add new features to Tinoecom, the first thing you need to do is to register a new element in the sidebar by creating an event (for example `RegisterCustomMenu`) and load it directly into your `AppServiceProvider` like this

```php
namespace App\Providers;

use Tinoecom\Sidebar\SidebarBuilder; // [tl! focus]

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
  public function registerCustomTinoecomSidebar() // [tl! focus:start]
  {
    $this->app['events']->listen(SidebarBuilder::class, RegisterCustomMenu::class);
  } // [tl! focus:end]
}
```

The rest of the configuration will be done using the configuration files in the `config/tinoecom/` folder

- `/routes.php` for the routes that should be dynamically loaded for the admin panel
- `/tinoecom.php` for the configuration that should be loaded for the cpanel.

We will deal with all this in more detail later.

## How not to extend Tinoecom

It should go without saying â€” but we'll say it anyway just in case...

Don't ever, for any reason, ever, no matter what, no matter where, or who, or who you are with, or where you are going or... 
or where you've been... ever, for any reason, whatsoever, edit the files inside `/vendor/tinoecom`. Or any other Composer package.
Anything you do will get blown away and you'll lose those changes forever and ever amen.

You should instead build addons, extensions, and submit pull requests to [admin](https://github.com/tinoecomlabs/tinoecom) (after checking with the team first 
if we'll accept them). Thanks!
