# Roles & Permissions

Manage access and permissions of your users and members in your store. The entire system of roles and permissions in Tinoecom is implemented by the package
[spatie/laravel-permission](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission). Because all permissions will be registered on Laravel's gate, you can test if a user 
has a permission with Laravel's default [can()](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/authorization#via-blade-templates) function.

To access dashboard, you need to have the role `administrator` this role can be found in the configuration file `config/tinoecom/core.php`.

```php
/*
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Configurations for the user
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| User configuration to manage user access using spatie/laravel-permission.
|
*/

'users' => [
  'admin_role' => 'administrator', // [tl! highlight]
  'default_role' => 'user',
],
```

After [creating a super admin](/installation#create-an-admin-user) we get the following result

```bash
php artisan tinoecom:user

Create Admin User for Tinoecom administration panel

 Email Address [admin@admin.com]:
 > arthur@tinoecomlabs.io

 First Name [Tinoecom]:
 > 

 Last Name [Admin]:
 > 

 Password:
 > 

 Confirm Password:
 > 

Creating admin account...
User created successfully.
```

After logged as an admin, you can add members with permissions on your staff to log in to your store and complete tasks like **Adding products** or managing **Orders** 
and use roles to control what sections of your store they can access.

Permissions help you manage what your store’s staff can do in your admin. Roles let you delegate, and assign the level of access that your staff needs to do their jobs effectively.

Permissions are associated with roles. Depending on the role that a member has, you can assign different types of permissions to it to limit or increase the actions they can do.

All this management of roles and permissions is done using the [Laravel Permission](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission) package from [Spatie](https://spatie.be).

At installation Laravel Tinoecom comes with 3 roles: **Administrator**, **Manager** and **User**, the user role cannot be modified from the administration interface 
because it is the role that will be assigned to any customer who will create his account on your shop.

## RBAC ACL

RBAC (Role Based Access Control) or ACL (Access Control Layer) is an approach to restricting system access for users using roles system, Laravel Tinoecom allow to define 
the level of access for each user. With roles a user can access menus, pages. It is important to know that one Administrator can have multiple roles assigned.

To view the roles and permissions management page, you must go to the **Settings > Staff & Permissions**

## Model

The model used for the **Role** is `Tinoecom\Core\Models\Role` this model extend from the Spatie Role model.

| Name             | Type    | Required | Notes                                                       |
|------------------|---------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`             | autoinc |          | auto                                                        |
| `name`           | string  | yes      | Role name in lowercase such as an slug (Eg.: author)        |
| `guard_name`     | string  | no       | This field is automatically filled in by Spatie             |
| `display_name`   | string  | no       | Nullable, the readable name for the role (Eg.: Blog Author) |
| `description`    | text    | no       | Nullable, the role description                              |
| `can_be_removed` | boolean | no       | Default `true`, defines if a role can be deleted.           |

And the **Permission** model is `Tinoecom\Core\Models\Permission`

| Name             | Type    | Required | Notes                                                             |
|------------------|---------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`             | autoinc |          | auto                                                              |
| `name`           | string  | yes      | Permission name in lowercase such as an slug (Eg.: create_post)   |
| `guard_name`     | string  | no       | This field is automatically filled in by Spatie                   |
| `group_name`     | string  | no       | Permissions can be grouped into groups to better organize them.   |
| `display_name`   | string  | no       | Nullable, the readable name for the permission (Eg.: Create Post) |
| `description`    | text    | no       | Nullable, the permission description                              |
| `can_be_removed` | boolean | no       | Default `true`, defines if a permission can be deleted.           |

The **Permission** model has some groups as shown here

```php
namespace Tinoecom\Core\Models\User;

use Spatie\Permission\Models\Permission as SpatiePermission;

class Permission extends SpatiePermission
{
  /**
   * Get a lists of permissions groups.
   */
  public static function groups(): array
  {
    return [
      'system' => __('System'),
      'brands' => __('Brands'),
      'categories' => __('Categories'),
      'collections' => __('Collections'),
      'products' => __('Products'),
      'customers' => __('Customers'),
      'orders' => __('Orders'),
      'discounts' => __('Discounts'),
    ];
  }
}
```

## Components

During the installation of Laravel Tinoecom, no component files are published by default to ensure a streamlined and hassle-free setup. 
However, if you need to customize or replace any components, you can easily publish them using the following Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan tinoecom:component:publish setting
```

A new `setting.php` file will be created in the `config/tinoecom/components` folder.

```php
use Tinoecom\Livewire;
use Tinoecom\Livewire\Components;
use Tinoecom\Livewire\Pages;

return [

    'pages' => [
        'legal' => Pages\Settings\LegalPage::class,
        'payment' => Pages\Settings\Payment::class,
        'team-index' => Pages\Settings\Team\Index::class, // [tl! focus]
        'team-roles' => Pages\Settings\Team\RolePermission::class, // [tl! focus]
        'zones' => Pages\Settings\Zones::class,
    ],
    
    'components' => [
        'modals.create-permission' => Livewire\Modals\CreatePermission::class, // [tl! focus]
        'modals.create-role' => Livewire\Modals\CreateRole::class, // [tl! focus]
        'modals.confirm-password' => Livewire\Modals\ConfirmPassword::class,
        'modals.logout-others-browser' => Livewire\Modals\LogoutOthersBrowser::class,
        'modals.payment-method-form' => Livewire\Modals\PaymentMethodForm::class,

        'settings.team.permissions' => Components\Settings\Team\Permissions::class, // [tl! focus]
        'settings.team.users' => Components\Settings\Team\UsersRole::class, // [tl! focus]
        'settings.zones.detail' => Components\Settings\Zones\Detail::class,
        'settings.zones.shipping-options' => Components\Settings\Zones\ZoneShippingOptions::class,

        'slide-overs.create-team-member' => Livewire\SlideOvers\CreateTeamMember::class, // [tl! focus]
        'slide-overs.shipping-option-form' => Livewire\SlideOvers\ShippingOptionForm::class,
        'slide-overs.zone-form' => Livewire\SlideOvers\ZoneForm::class,
    ],

];
```

## Manage Roles

A Role is a set of permissions to perform certain operations within the system, which is assigned to a chosen Administrator. As said previously Tinoecom 
at installation comes with 3 roles but 2 are accessible in the administration panel.
The user role does not appear, modifying it could lead to bugs on your store so it is not listed here.


:::warning
It's **strongly** advised to not change the name of roles when they are already assigned to users. If the role verification is done manually you will be forced to change this name in all **middleware**, **helpers**, **blade directives** etc.
:::

### Add role

To add a new role, you must click on `Add a new role` button. Required fields are marked with asterisks

<div class="screenshot">
  <img src="/screenshots/{{version}}/add-role.png" alt="addd new role">
  <div class="caption">Add new role</div>
</div>

The added roles can be used later in your code to assign functionality or access resources.

### Update role

To modify a role you must click on the role you want to modify to access the edit form.

And as already mentioned, all Tinoecom features are livewire components. So you can change everything at any time to fit your store.

<div class="screenshot">
  <img src="/screenshots/{{version}}/update-role.png" alt="update role">
  <div class="caption">Update role</div>
</div>

### Create admin

In addition to creating an administrator from the command line you can also do it from the Tinoecom interface, you just need to click on **Add Administrator** button.
Then you fill in the information of your administrator with the role chosen for him

<div class="screenshot">
  <img src="/screenshots/{{version}}/add-admin.png" alt="add new admin">
  <div class="caption">Add admin</div>
</div>

The actual role registration function looks like the code below. And the whole implementation class is `Tinoecom\Livewire\SlideOvers\CreateTeamMember`

### Create permission

Let’s assume that you would like to add a new permission to ACL. You will need to choose the role because every single permissions are linked to a role.

In the way that when an admin are granted of a specific role, he will granted all role's permissions.

<div class="screenshot">
  <img src="/screenshots/{{version}}/permissions.png" alt="Role's permissions example">
  <div class="caption">Role's permissions</div>
</div>

As you may have noticed all permissions are grouped by type, and the available types are mentioned above in this [section](/roles-permissions#fields).

To add a new permission you just need to click on the **Create permission** button.

<div class="screenshot">
  <img src="/screenshots/{{version}}/add-permission.png" alt="Add permission">
  <div class="caption">Add permission</div>
</div>

After adding your permission it will be automatically associated with the role and therefore all administrators with this role will have this permission.

If the permission has no group it will be in a `Custom permissions` section.

<div class="screenshot">
  <img src="/screenshots/{{version}}/custom-permissions.png" alt="new permission">
  <div class="caption">New permission</div>
</div>
