### Components

By default, pricing Livewire components are not published. To customize components, you must publish them.

```bash
php artisan tinoecom:component:publish product
```

This command will publish all Livewire components used for product and price management (from pages to form components).
Once you've published the component, you can find it in the `product.php` locate in the `config/tinoecom/components` folder.
```php
use Tinoecom\Livewire;

return [
  'components' => [
        // ...
        'products.pricing' => Components\Products\Pricing::class,
        'slide-overs.manage-pricing' => Livewire\SlideOvers\ManagePricing::class,
        // ...
  ],
];
```
